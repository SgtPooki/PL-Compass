# PL Compass project (Launchpad)

## Problem statement

There are so many cool ideas and project happening at PL, but it is hard to navigate and understand what is happening where and what was already done/being in progress

## Project statement

Improve discoverability and traceability of the projects developed, running and depricated by people at Protocol Labs without the need for manual db management


## Key features

- Internal focus → People in PL should be able to figure out what things are being developed right now and navigate to find the useful resources for them easily
- Simple update → Databases with multiple source of input are hard to maintain, this process should be automated as much as possiple
- Simple discoverability → Representation of the information should be convenient for users to navigate through, finding relevant information through queries, labels or mind maps
- Simple traceability → Figure out who was the person responsible for the project and what were all the contributers to it during its lifetime

## Tool description

Simple website similar to https://ecosystem.filecoin.io/ for navigating across existing Tools → Github Projects → Consumer use-cases in Protocol Labs for better structure and love to the projects being created in PL and its community
