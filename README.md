# PL Compass project (Launchpad)

## Problem statement

There are so many cool ideas and project happening at PL, but it is hard to navigate and understand what is happening where and what was already done/being in progress

## Project statement

Improve discoverability and traceability of the projects developed, running and deprecated by people at Protocol Labs without the need for manual db management

Valuable projects would surface more easily, get more contributions, and we'd minimize the amount of energy "wasted" reinventing things in the web3 industry.

Plus:

- More developers will create projects and apps using PL ecosystem if docs are easily to find / easily to read
- You can view a collection of PL projects in a single place, and navigate to each of them easily. The index/list/collection should include their github stars, health, activity, etc..
- You could also filter based on language, category or other -- e.g. more contributors & attention for projects

## Key features

- Internal focus → People in PL should be able to figure out what things are being developed right now and navigate to find the useful resources for them easily
- Simple update → Databases with multiple source of input are hard to maintain, this process should be automated as much as possible
- Simple discoverability → Representation of the information should be convenient for users to navigate through, finding relevant information through queries, labels or mind maps
- Simple traceability → Figure out who was the person responsible for the project and what were all the contributors to it during its lifetime

## Tool description

Simple website similar to https://ecosystem.filecoin.io/ for navigating across existing Tools → Github Projects → Consumer use-cases in Protocol Labs for better structure and love to the projects being created in PL and its community
